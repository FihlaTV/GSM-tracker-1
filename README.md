GSM-Tracker
=========

GSM-Tracker is a small bit of PHP to accept location pings (Cell Id from a GSM device), keep a log of positions and display a map with that location. 

You need a OpenCellID API key in order to query for the location from the gsm cell info. You can request it in the web page: http://opencellid.org/#action=database.requestForApiKey
