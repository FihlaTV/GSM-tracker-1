OsmAnd-Tracker
=========

OsmAnd-Tracker is a small bit of PHP to accept location pings from [OsmAnd](http://www.osmand.net) and display a static map with that location. 

The map is suitable for placement inside of an iframe element on a personal website or such. The functionality is similar to the Google Latitude "location badge" feature but allows you to control your own information and uses the MapQuest Open [static map API](http://open.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/) to generate a simple image with a location pin on it.
